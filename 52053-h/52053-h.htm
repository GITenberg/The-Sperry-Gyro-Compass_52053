<p class="dropcap">HEN
the earth was thrown off from the sun and commenced rotating
about its own axis, there was developed a force generated by the
earth’s rotation. For countless centuries this force has been at work,
but no one has ever been able to harness it to serve the purposes of
man. But now, through the efforts of Foucault, Hopkins, Sperry,
and other noted scientists, this force has been put to work. It serves
to direct a thousand ships in their courses.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not the only force which has been used to guide
ships. Since 1297 A.D. mariners have used magnetic attraction as the force by which
to guide their vessels. For centuries seafaring men sailed only in wooden ships, and
were therefore satisfied with the magnetic compass. Then came steam and steel.
Navigation then instead of being a hit or miss game of chance became the exact art of
directing a ship by the shortest possible course in the quickest possible time.</p>

<p>Now that ships cost millions of dollars to build and thousands of dollars per day
to operate, time has become the most essential element in navigation. The development
of ships from the sailing vessel to the ocean greyhound has been one of the marvels
of modern times. But the development of the magnetic compass has not kept pace
with the development of the ships which rely upon it. Many of the great trans-Atlantic
liners are guided by practically the same type of compass as that which Columbus
used on the <i>Santa Maria</i>. The compass on the wooden <i>Santa Maria</i> pointed to magnetic
north with a fair degree of accuracy, but the compass on the steel greyhounds must
contend with many distractions.</p></div>

</div>

<div class="bodytext">
<p>For years magnetic compass designers spent their efforts to produce
compensating devices that would annul the effects of all external
influences, so that the magnetic compass would be free to indicate only
the direction of the earth’s magnetic lines. Very little has been done
to improve the compass itself—it still depends upon the attraction of
the Magnetic North Pole. The Sperry Gyro-Compass differs in principle
from any other compass. It is not magnetic. It derives its directive
force, not from magnetic attraction, but from the earth’s
rotation.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

 <div class="caption">The Vikings crossed the Atlantic in open ships.</div>
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
<p>There is certainly a crying need
for this new type of compass. A ship
now-a-days costs millions of dollars
and carries cargoes usually equal in
value to that of the ship. It has been
estimated that inaccuracies in navigation attending the use of the magnetic compass
cause a yearly loss of ships to the value of $70,000,000. No estimate can possibly be
made on the value of lives lost on these ships.</p>

<p>Millions of dollars are spent each year on charts, lighthouses, buoys, geodetic and
hydrographic surveys, and on compilation of notices to mariners. Notwithstanding all
of these, ships must ultimately depend upon their compasses for their safety and
efficiency of navigation.</p>

<p>Inaccuracies in navigation can be eliminated by the use of a reliable compass. The
Sperry Gyro-Compass puts the earth to work. It utilizes a force which is as unvarying
as the law of gravity, a force that cannot be interfered with by any other influence.</p>

<h3>How the Earth’s Rotation Is Utilized</h3>

<p>Any wheel rotating at a high speed about its own axis, and free to place itself in
any plane, is called a <i>Gyroscope</i>. The <i>Gyroscope</i> is the instrument which utilizes the
earth’s rotation as a force to direct the course of ships.</p>

<p>Suppose you were to place such a small wheel supported by its axis upon a larger
wheel which also is revolving. The rotation of the larger wheel would so influence
the smaller wheel that its axis would point in the same direction as the axis of the larger
wheel. Why this is the case does not concern us here. Let it suffice that the larger
wheel will cause the smaller wheel to behave in this manner. This is in accordance with
a natural law. This law operates as unfailingly as the law which causes an unsupported
body to fall to the ground.</p>
</div><!--bodytext-->

<div class="figleft imwth06">
<img src="images/i_p08.jpg" width="312" height="237"
 alt="Preparing Master Compass for Test." />
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
<p>Suppose the larger wheel happens to be the earth, which in reality is a revolving
wheel. Suppose further, the small wheel is a Sperry Gyro-Compass. In accordance with
this natural law just outlined the smaller wheel, or Gyro-Compass, will point its axis in
the same direction as the axis of the earth, or, in other words, to the true or geographical
North Pole. This explanation of the principle of gyroscopic motion is necessarily crude.
The principle itself has been established
beyond any reasonable doubt.
It can be proved by mathematics to
the satisfaction of the most exacting
scientist and has been demonstrated,
throughout the navies of the world,
to practical seamen.</p>

<p>The final result is that we have
a principle which enables us to construct
an instrument which will place
itself in the true geographic north and
south meridian, and that it responds
to no influence or impulse other than
the earth’s unvarying rotation.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

<p class="dropcap">HE purpose of a compass
is to indicate direction. The relative
position of the North Pole to any point on the earth’s surface is
called North. We figure all direction from this conception. This
geographical North Pole is called the True North. About 800 miles
from this True North Pole is a spot which has a strange magnetic
attraction. The needle of the magnetic compass, if undisturbed by
local influences, points to this spot, and not to the True North Pole.
This spot is called the Magnetic North Pole. This mysterious attractive spot is not
stationary. It moves about from year to year within a wide
circle.<br class="clearfix" /></p>
</div><!--bodytext-->

<div class="figleft imwth08">
<img src="images/i_p10.jpg" width="252" height="347"
 alt="Master Compasses Awaiting Shipment." />
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
<p>Inasmuch as the navigator must refer to True North, he must determine the angle or
variation between True North and Magnetic North as indicated by his magnetic compass.
This determination is made comparatively easy by using charts which express in
degrees the difference between Magnetic North and True North for any point on the
earth’s surface.</p>

<p>Such a chart is shown in Figure 3. Also on each chart used by a navigator for a
particular locality there is marked a compass rose in which is recorded the variation for
that exact spot as of a certain date, and in addition the rate at which the variation
changes annually, Figure 4.</p>

<p>Navigation along a coast line where sights can be taken on buoys or lighthouses is
simple, and is termed “piloting.” This, of course,
can be done without the aid of a compass.</p>

<p>Upon getting to open sea the mariner checks
his position in a similar manner, by observing
the position of his ship in relation to the position
of the sun, moon or stars. Between observations
the position of a ship is determined by “dead
reckoning.” The distance it has traveled from
the last known position is measured by the ship’s
log and the direction is indicated by the compass.
Very often for days at a time, owing to weather
conditions, it is impossible to get an observation

navigator is dependent entirely upon the compass.
The slightest error in the compass, due to
variation or deviation, in such circumstances
will cause the ship to be miles out of its course,

calculated position.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

<h3>Influences Due to Roll and Pitch of the Ship</h3>

<div class="bodytext"><div class="csstable">
<div class="tabrow">
<div class="tabcellleft tabwth50">
<h4>The Magnetic Compass</h4>

<p>Another error, called heel­ing error, is
caused by the change in the dis­pos­i­tion of
the material of the ship with ref­er­ence to the
com­pass. It is brought about when the ship
rolls. For example, a ship heading on a
northerly course would, if rolled to port,
place all magnetic material of the ship to the
east­ward of the compass. This pulls the
north end of the com­pass to the east­ward.
The action and effect would be just opposite
to this on a roll to the star­board. The result
is that the needle is caused to oscil­late in
either direc­tion. The helms­man in his
attempt to keep “on” will cause the ship to
traverse a sinuous course.</p>

<p>The card and needle of the mag­netic
compass are placed in a bowl filled with
a liquid. The purpose in so doing is to make
the action of the card some­what slug­gish, so
that it will not follow very slight magnetic
dis­trac­tions or ship move­ments. Every
time the course of the ship is changed the
slug­gish action, due to adhesion between the
bowl, liquid and card, pulls the com­pass off
the mer­i­di­an. Of­ficial test has shown that
from three to four minutes are re­quired for
the com­pass to over­come this “lag.” The
“lag” is some­what less in the dry card
compass.</p></div>

<div class="tabcell">
<h4>The Sperry Gyro-Compass</h4>

<p>Not only is the Sperry Gy­ro-Com­pass
unaf­fec­ted by mag­ne­tic con­di­tions, re­sult­ing
from the heel­ing error, but before being
placed upon the ship it is tested for days
under con­di­tions sim­u­lat­ing the mo­tion of
the ship in the most severe storm.</p>

<p>A ship steered by the Gyro-Compass
trav­erses a straight line course; the Gyro-Com­pass
does not os­cil­late with the rol­ling
of the ship. It is not nec­es­sary for the helms­man
to use as much helm to keep the ship
on her course. A great saving is made in the
use of the steering engine.</p>

<p>There is no “lag” in the Sper­ry Gy­ro-Com­pass,
be­cause it does not leave the
mer­i­dian, no mat­ter which way or how
quick­ly the ship may turn or zig-zag. Ex­haus­tive
tests have been con­duct­ed on com­pas­ses
installed on torpedo boat des­troy­ers.
Even when zig-zag­ging at top speed
in heavy seas the Gy­ro-Com­pass shows no
“lag.”</p>

<p>Trav­e­ling the straight line course instead
of the sin­u­ous course, ships equipped with
the Sper­ry Gy­ro-Com­pass have saved from
one to ten per cent in time over the average
sched­ule time re­quired to cov­er their
courses when steering by the mag­ne­tic
com­pass.</p></div></div>

<h3>Warning of Unreliability</h3>

<p>Due to mag­net­ic storms and any num­ber
of other causes the mag­net­ic com­pass may

can­not be de­ter­mined. The nav­i­gat­or is

<p class="dropcap">URING the construction of a steel ship it is usual to build it on ways the
direction of which lie in the East-West line. Should the ways be
placed in a North-South line the riveting on the keel and plates tends
to help the molecules of metal to place themselves parallel to the
magnetic lines of force, and magnetize the metal. When placed in
the East-West line the molecules of metal in the plates are at right
angles to the magnetic lines of force, and are not as easily magnetized.
The use of the Gyro-Compass eliminates the necessity of placing the ways
in the East-West line.</p>

<p>After a large ship has been launched, and during the fitting out period, it is often
necessary to have it swung end for end in order to neutralize or equalize the magnetism
induced by the earth’s magnetic field. To swing a large ship end for end costs anywhere
from one thousand ($1000) to three thousand ($3000) dollars. The Gyro-Compass is
unaffected by any magnetic phenomena, and is so dependable that it makes the swinging
of the ship unnecessary.</p>

<p>In constructing a ship it is customary to make all metal parts within approximately
ten (10) feet of the magnetic-compass stand of bronze, brass or other non-magnetic
material. The proximity of magnetic metals seriously affects the accuracy of the compass.
All electric leads are run so as to clear the vicinity of the compass, as the magnetic
fields set up by such conductors seriously influence the compass needle. Actual experience
is on record that the total installation cost of the Sperry Gyro-Compass has been
saved many times over by the elimination of special metals
and special run of electric leads.</p>

<p>Before starting on a long voyage, es­pec­ial­ly with a new ship using
the mag­ne­tic compass, it is cust­o­mary to swing the ship through a
comp­lete circle to check dev­i­a­tion. To swing ship it is first nec­es­sary
to pick out a suit­able ob­ject on land having a known bear­ing to the
ship. This object is used as a ref­er­ence point. If at sea ob­ser­va­tions
are taken on the sun. The ship is then swung through 360 degrees,
stop­ping usually on each 15-degree head­ing, and noting the dev­i­a­tion.
A table is made up showing the deviation on each of these headings.
An attempt is then made to so adjust or manipulate the compensating
magnets to eliminate the error found. The ship must then again be
swung through 360 degrees, stopping at headings as before to check the
applied compensation.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

Errors of Magnetic Compass Cause Departure From Desired Course.</div>
</div>

<p>On some ships it is the custom to check the deviation by the deflector magnet
method. The ship in this case is put on a certain heading and a magnet placed to one
side of the compass and the deviation noted. The same magnet is then placed at an
equal distance to the opposite side and the deviation noted. The difference, if any,
between the readings is the deviation on that particular course.</p>

<p>With either meth­od of check­ing for dev­i­a­tion, con­sid­er­able time is used. It is not
nec­es­sary to check for dev­i­a­tion or ap­ply any com­pen­sa­tion to the Gyro-Com­pass, as it
is not mag­net­ic. In fact the Gy­ro-Com­pass has noth­ing
what­ever to do with magnetism.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

<p>When at sea the Gyro-Compass af­fords the means of keep­ing to the straight-line,
true course. The line <span class="nowrap">A B,</span>
Figure 5, shows the straight-line course from the port
of New York to the port of
Liver­pool. The line <span class="nowrap">A C E B</span> shows,
with exag­ger­a­tion, the actual
course steered due to com­pass and
other er­rors. At the point E the
ship’s position was checked by
observation of a celestial body.
The line <span class="nowrap">E B</span> represents the new
course set to bring the ship to her
destination. This is an occurrence
which sometimes happens not once
but often during a voyage.</p>

<p>It is evident that a loss of time
is in­volved when the ship leaves
her straight line course. The in­her­ent ac­curacy of the Sper­ry Gy­ro-Com­pass en­ables
the ship to keep to the straight line course, and also to steer di­rect­ly on true courses.</p>

<p>By keeping on a straight line course the ship is en­abled to make
a good many more miles on the same num­ber of rev­o­lu­tions or turns of
the pro­pel­ler. Under ex­actly the same weath­er con­di­tions a 16,000 ton
lin­er made 370 miles in 24 hours at an av­er­age of 86.95 rev­o­lu­tions per
min­ute per mile when steered by a mag­ne­tic com­pass, and the same lin­er
made 377 miles with 85.61 rev­o­lu­tions per min­ute per mile when steered
by the Gy­ro-Com­pass. This sav­ing amounts to eas­ily $50 per day for this
ship. Dur­ing her elev­en-day voy­age she saved $550. At this rate of
sav­ing the Gy­ro-Com­pass equip­ment is soon paid
for.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

<p>The Sperry Gyro-Compass does not oscillate with the rolling of the ship, or in
other words, has no heeling error. The use of the helm is greatly diminished. Records
show that on one trans-Atlantic liner a saving of 24 percent in the revolutions of the
steering engine, when steered by Gyro-Compass, was effected. One of the largest
trans-Atlantic liners reports that but one-third of the helm is used when the ship is

<p>This saving in the use of the steering engine gives actual proof that the ship navigated
by a Gyro-Compass steers a straight line course. It further proves that the ship does not
divert its slip-stream as often—the power output of the main engines is thereby reduced.</p>

<p>Records taken on a well-known passenger liner show that in making her regular
trip between New York and Jacksonville, Florida, she saved more than two hours
due to steering by a Sperry Gyro-Compass. A saving of 3,410 turns of her propeller
was also effected. These savings were made even with much greater than the usual draft.</p>

<p>Records taken by means of the Sperry Recording Compass show that when the
helmsman is given a certain course he can keep the ship one and one-half degrees
nearer the course when steering by the Gyro-Compass than when steering by magnetic

<p>The Gyro-Compass can make great savings in money both in construction and
operation of the ship. These factors are perhaps trivial when compared with the safety
factor introduced by the use of the Sperry Gyro-Compass.</p>

<p>Due to the elim­i­na­tion of the many un­cer­tain­ties
of the mag­netic com­pass, insurance com­pan­ies
are fav­or­ably dis­posed toward the use of
the Sper­ry Gy­ro-Com­pass, which ul­ti­mate­ly will
re­sult in a re­duc­tion of in­sur­ance rates.</p>

<p>The use of the Sper­ry Gy­ro-Com­pass elim­in­ates
in­ac­cu­ra­cies due to nav­i­ga­tion, there­by
sav­ing time, in­suring the ship, the car­go, and the
lives of pas­sen­gers and crew.</p>

<p>Sper­ry Gy­ro-Com­pas­ses are op­er­at­ing on
many of the world’s larg­est and fast­est pas­sen­ger
lin­ers and car­go ships. These ships are ma­king
sav­ings every day of fuel used and time re­quired
to make their courses. The nav­i­ga­tors using
these com­pas­ses find that they can come very
much nearer their cal­cu­lat­ed po­si­tions when
steer­ing by the Gy­ro-Com­pass. The Gy­ro-Com­pass
makes the art of nav­i­ga­tion more exact.</p>

<p>The Sperry Gyro-Compass is the only one to
pass the service tests in the world’s
navies.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

<div class="bodytext">
<p>As shown in the pho­to­graphs and sec­tion­al view,
the twin gyro-wheels are sup­port­ed from a frame-work
which is in turn set in gim­bal rings. The out­er gim­bal
ring is at­tached to the bin­nacle stand by means of a
num­ber of sup­port­ing springs. The springs are pro­vid­ed
for pro­tect­ing the com­pass against sud­den jars and

<p>A diagrammatic representation of the Sperry
Gyro-Compass is shown in plan view in Figure 17. The
elevation, or side view, is shown in Figure 15. These
drawings show the working parts of the Gyro-Compass.
Each of the twin gyro-wheels is enclosed in a case,
which is in turn suspended from the main frame and
spider.</p>

<p>The wheels are spun at a high
speed in unison by means of electricity.
The force of the earth’s
rotation combines with the force
resulting from the rotating wheels.
The resultant action of these two
forces is that both wheels turn their
axes directly into, or parallel with,
the earth’s north and south meridian.
The compass card, of course, also
turns and indicates direction by comparing
the stationary “lubber line,”
representing the ship’s head, with
the compass card.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

<p>A single gyro-wheel would cons­ti­tute a sat­is­fact­ory
sta­tion­ary, or “land com­pass.” On ship­board the roll,
yaw and pitch of the ship would impose ad­di­tion­al duty
on a single wheel. It would have to point not only True
North, but also offset the effect of the sea. One of the
two wheels is ar­ranged to always point True North,
while its twin wheel op­poses and neutralizes all in­fluences
other than the force of the earth’s rotation. The force
of both wheels is utilized in seeking the mer­i­dian.</p>

<p>The Master Gyro-Compass is a marvel of mech­an­ical
per­fec­tion and rug­ged­ness. Every ro­tat­ing or re­volv­ing
part moves upon special bearings to reduce friction. It
should be noted also that the gyro-wheels do not directly
operate the compass card. The compass card is turned
by a small electric motor (Azimuth Motor), Figure 17.
The slightest change in position between the wheels and
card operates the “trolley” or electrical contact, which
controls the Azimuth Motor. The card is made to
“shadow” the wheels. The follow-up is so close that the
card frame has been called the “phantom.”</p>

<p>An electrical transmitter, Figure 17, is operated by
the movement of the card. This transmitter is the means by which the repeaters are
kept in unison with the movements of the Master Gyro-Compass, and made to show the
exact reading at any instant. Again the Azimuth Motor furnishes the very slight
amount of power required to operate this
device.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

<p>The Master Compass is placed near the center of the ship at the water line. At
this point the effect of rolling is at a minimum. It is, however, not necessary to place it
exactly at this position. Figure 13 shows the approximate location of the various
pieces of equipment aboard ship.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

<h3>The Repeaters</h3>

<p>A familiar application of the repeater principle is that used in hotels and public
buildings, where a number of repeater clocks are operated from one master instrument.
Likewise, the repeater used upon the bridge, the bearing repeater, and the one at the
after steering station, are all operated by electricity in perfect unison with the Master
Gyro-Compass and show the exact reading of the Master at any instant. Repeaters are
operated by a small electric motor within each case, controlled by the transmitter at the
Master Gyro. In designing the repeaters particular attention has been given to the
electrical circuits so as to make all connections water, spray and condensation proof.
Stuffing tubes of improved design are used at all outlets and entrances.</p>

<p>A miniature electric lamp within the repeater supplies the necessary illumination
of the dial. The illumination can be brightened or dimmed by turning the switch handle
on the face of the terminal box.</p>

<p>The repeaters are supplied in three styles:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Repeater mounted on steering stand—for use on bridge.</li>

<li>2. Bearing repeater mounted within pelorus stand.</li>

<li>3. Repeater mounted on bulkhead in Master’s room, or
 at the after steering station.</li></ul>

<p>Special stands or fixtures can be supplied if necessary.</p>

<p>A metal “non-reflection” cover is supplied which can be fitted to either the bridge
or the after steering repeaters. The cover has adjustable doors and a hood. Its object
is to exclude all light from the top glass of the repeater except at the lubber’s line. No
light will be reflected into the eyes of the helmsman. The doors can be closed until a
very small sector of the repeater dial appears at the lubber’s line. Experience has
proved that it is easier to watch and concentrate when only a small portion of the dial
is visible. A magnifying glass can be used in conjunction with the cover so that the
repeater indication can be read at a distance.</p>
</div><!--bodytext-->

<img src="images/i_p25-2.jpg" width="288" height="384"
 alt="Bearing Repeater with
Sperry Azimuth
Circle." />
</div>

<div class="bodytext">
<p>The bridge and after steering repeaters are
mounted on ad­just­able brack­ets. The position
of the repeater can be changed so as to allow a
full face view of the dial from almost any angle.</p>

<p>The bearing repeater is of great aid to the
navigator. The repeater is mounted within the
stand and, of course, shows the exact reading of
the Master Compass. In taking a bearing on a
distant object or a sun azimuth it is not necessary
to first set the “dumb” compass to correspond
with the main com­pass. A cons­tant true ind­i­ca­tion
is af­ford­ed.</p>

<p>Installation of the bear­ing re­peat­er can be
made in such a po­si­tion on the up­per bridge so
that it may be used for steering from that
position as well as for taking bearings. A special
pelorus stand cover can be supplied with windows
to allow steering with the cover on, so as to protect
the repeater from spray and the
weather.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

<div class="bodytext">
<p>An improved design of azimuth circle is furnished which fits directly over the top
of the repeater. Figures 24 and 26, on page 30, show the azimuth circle and bearing repeater
in use, taking a bearing on a distant object, and on the sun respectively. This
azimuth circle is so constructed as to bring the object, the spirit level and dial within
the field of vision concurrently. The bearing can be taken with great accuracy. There
is no possibility of the Master Compass changing its position while the pelorus is in use.
Such an occurrence is not uncommon when using the ordinary pelorus or “dummy” compass.</p>

<p>An additional graduated ring, Figure 25, is supplied for placing under the azimuth
circle so that in case the Gyro-Compass is not operating such, for instance, as when
the ship is at anchor, the pelorus can still be used as a “dumb” compass. The main
compass setting is made upon the ring, and the azimuth circle used in the usual manner.</p>

<p>The bearing repeater can be furnished with any one of three kinds of azimuth
circles. The Ritchie circle is usually supplied. The purchaser also has the option of
choosing either the Sperry circle or the Kelvin Azimuth Mirror.</p>

<h3>Compass Control-Panel</h3>

<p>The compass control-panel provides a means for controlling the various electrical
parts of the Gyro-Compass, the storage battery, motor-generator and ship’s supply
current. It is very compact, neat, and of good appearance. It receives electrical power
from the ship’s mains and distributes it to the motor-generator set, Master Compass
and repeater.</p>

<p>The switch panel is made up of black ebony asbestos, mounted upon angle iron.
The panel is usually mounted with its back near the bulkheads, but so hinged as to
admit of access to its rear.</p>

<h3>Stor­age Bat­tery</h3>

<p>The complete failure of

modern ship is an event of
rare occurrence. If, however,
such a contingency
should occur, provision has
been made for it in the Gyro-Compass equipment by
supplying a storage battery of sufficient capacity to
operate the entire equipment for a period of two hours.
The battery is so connected electrically as to keep
itself in a charged condition while the compass is
operating under normal conditions.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

<h3>Sperry Recording Compass</h3>

<p>An outstanding feature of the Gyro-Compass is
that it makes possible the recording of the actual
courses steered by a vessel. The recording compass
is connected to the electrical circuits like a repeater
and follows the movements of the Master Compass.
It not only indicates the heading at any instant, but
also makes a graphic record on a chart. Radial lines
on the chart represent the various courses. Concentric
circles represent time—each small division five
minutes—each large division one hour.</p>

<p>The dial on which the chart is mounted turns
with the movements of the master compass bringing
the correct course under the marking point. As the
time advances a line is marked on the chart showing the exact course steered at a
definite time. On starting, the marking arm is at the inner edge, clockwork moves
it toward the outer edge with uniform motion.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

<div class="figright imwth06">
<img src="images/i_p32b.jpg" width="312" height="305"
 alt="" /><div class="caption">Figure 32.</div>
</div>

<p>The chart shown in Figure 32 forms a valuable record. It was taken on a ship at
a time a radio call was received from a burning
oil tanker. Being within the distance
defined by law, the ship was legally, as well
as morally bound to proceed to the distressed
ship. The chart shows that the
course was altered to go to the tanker’s aid.
It also showed the exact time, thereby
establishing proof as to the fulfillment of
the obligation. A few minutes later another
radio call advised that the fire aboard the
tanker was extinguished. The chart shows
that the course was again altered to bring
the vessel back on her original given course.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

</div>

<div class="bodytext">
<p>The chart further shows the actual
courses steered in holding the ship on its
given course. It shows just how efficiently each helmsman handles the ship. It provides
an excellent method of training helmsmen to use less helm, effecting a saving by less
frequent use of the steering engine.</p>

<p>The recording compass is a great aid to the Captain and Navigator in improving
the navigating efficiency of the ship.</p>

<p>The recording compass can be supplied as a part of the Gyro-Compass equipment—its
additional cost is small when compared to the saving and benefits derived from its use.</p>

<h3>Operation</h3>

<p>The operation of the Sperry Gyro-Compass is made easy by making all parts as
simple as possible.</p>

<p>In starting the equipment it is necessary to turn but one switch. The twin wheels
immediately start spinning and will in a short time come up to the normal speed.</p>

<p>After the speed has been attained, a short time is allowed for the wheels to cause
their axes to “settle,” or, in other words, to seek and hold the meridian.</p>

<p>In case of failure of the ship’s supply, or other trouble, an audible signal immediately
gives indication that something is wrong. This is a decided improvement over the
ordinary compass, as no indication is afforded of the presence of factors which cause
errors in its reading.</p>

<h3>Care</h3>

<p>All of the greatest commercial aids require some care, such, for instance, as the
telephone, typewriter, adding machine, duplicating machine and so on.</p>
</div><!--bodytext-->

<div class="figright imwth08">
<img src="images/i_p33.jpg" width="252" height="357"
 alt="Bearing Repeater Equipped with Windows
 in Storm Cover." /></div>

<div class="bodytext">
<p>The magnetic compasses aboard ship receive
especially watchful attention, to see that
they are not meddled or tampered with. As a
rule the entire ship’s crew, including the
youngest apprentice, knows that the compass
must in no way be handled.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the Sperry
Gyro-Compass is a mechanical compass. Although
the very best materials, design and skill
enter into its construction, it is still liable to
failure. Even with that possibility, it is so
superior to the magnetic compass that it more
than justifies its installation use. In the same
way the electric light, although liable to failure,
is vastly superior to the old oil lamp. The oil
lamps are seldom used, yet they are carried
aboard ships for the contingency which might
happen. Similarly a failure of the electric or
hydraulic steering gear may necessitate the
temporary use of the inefficient hand-steering
gear.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

<h3>Work­man­ship</h3>

<p>The Sper­ry Gy­ro-Com­pass is an ins­tru­ment of pre­cision. From the work done by
the Gy­ro-Com­pass and the ob­jects ac­comp­lished it would be natural to class it as a
sci­en­tif­ic ins­tru­ment. It is, however, more than that for the reason that it has been
made strong and sturdy for operation under the
most severe conditions at sea. The most expert
and skilled workmanship is required to combine
strength and precision, such as found in the
Gyro-Compass. The Sperry organization prides
itself upon having the best workmen that can be
obtained for their respective vocations.</p>

<p>The materials used are the very best obtainable.
The rigid and inflexible set of purchasing
specifications insures receiving the best materials.</p>

<p>A well organized inspection force passes upon
all material upon its receipt, and through the
various manufacturing stages to the final
product.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

under which it will have to operate. Figures 38 and
39 show a compass mounted on a stand which is
operated by means of motor driven gears, cams, etc., so as to reproduce the roll, pitch
and yaw of a ship at sea. Absolute accuracy of the Master Compass and all repeaters
while operating under this condition is required.</p>

<p>The purchaser is thereby assured that the compass to be installed upon his ship will
have had all manufacturing inaccuracies or so-called “kinks” worked out. A record
of the test accompanies each compass.</p>

<h3>Packing</h3>

<p>Special care is taken in packing the Gyro-Compass for shipment. Experience
gained from the shipment of hundreds of compasses has devised means whereby to
insure the safe arrival of all parts so that installation will not be delayed.</p>

<p>In order that no injury may result to any parts, the Gyro-Compass is unpacked
under the supervision of the Sperry Service Engineer.</p>

<h3>The Sperry Service Organization</h3>

<p>The Sperry Service Organization is one which serves in all parts of the world.
A corps of Service Engineers, having special training at the factory in all departments
relating to the Gyro-Compass, are available in nearly every large port of the world.
These engineers are ready to come aboard your ship, to clean, adjust and overhaul the
Gyro-Compass, thus relieving the navigator of all care other than the actual use of
the Gyro-Compass.</p>

<p>During the war we had Service Engineers in every port where the ships of the Navy
were likely to call. Our men have been in many of the naval actions and have been
able to render very con­sid­er­able service on many
un­usual oc­cas­ions. For example, it
was desired to place an equipment on a British ship which was on her way to the Dardanelles.
The Admiralty instructed us by telegram to have an equipment and a Service
Engineer meet the ship at the British
Naval Station at Malta in the
Mediterranean. By sending the
equipment with our Service Engineer
via a passenger train to the south of
Italy and via destroyer to Malta we
were able to meet the ship there on
the day she arrived. The ship was
able to stay only twenty-four hours,
and as it took about four days to install the equipment,
our engineer
remained on board and finished the
work while the ship was enroute from
Malta to the Dardanelles.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

<div class="bodytext"><p>This ship, the <i>Inflexible</i>, arrived at the Dardanelles just in time to join in the first
naval action directed against the land batteries. During the first part of the engagement
our engineer remained with the Master Compass which was installed near the dynamo
room. When he saw that it was functioning properly he left it to go on deck and view
the action, the effects of which he had become aware of, as a number of shells from the
land batteries had hit the ship. Almost immediately after he arrived on deck a torpedo
struck the ship directly under the compartment where the Gyro-Compass was located,
killing every man in that compartment. Although badly damaged the ship was able to
get out of range of the land batteries and reach the naval base near the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>The Gyro-Compass was, of course, almost totally destroyed. Shortly after the
action ended our engineer was enabled to get ashore on a Greek island via one of the
British destroyers. This island had a telegraph station which he used to cable us that
“Equipment No. 286 is under four feet of water,” and that we should have another
equipment ready to replace it. We took this telegram to the Admiralty who authorized
us to have another equipment prepared to meet this ship at Gibraltar. This we did,
again sending a Service Engineer who met the ship at Gibraltar, on her way back to
England to be repaired and refitted.</p>

<p>The Sperry Service Organization stands ready to help all ships equipped with a
Gyro-Compass at all times, even in emergencies such as those experienced by naval vessels.</p>

<div class="bodytext">
<p>At the time of the battle of Coronel on the west coast of
South America, H. M. S. <i>In­vin­ci­ble</i> was being over­hauled
at the Ports­mouth Dock­yard in Eng­land. She was im­med­i­ate­ly
ord­ered with one other large British ship to South American
waters under the com­mand of Ad­mir­al Stur­dee, to re-enforce
the British fleet, and then to find and destroy the German
ships which had defeated the British at the battle of
Coronel. When the overhaul of the <i>Invincible</i> was completed
and she was ready to leave the docks, it was at first planned
to delay sailing until the ship could be swung and the
magnetic compasses compensated. It was decided, however,
that although the compasses were badly in need of adjustment
it was necessary to save every minute in order to reach
South American waters before the German ships could find
and destroy the British ships remaining in those waters.
The <i>Invincible</i> therefore sailed without adjusting her
magnetic compasses and navigated entirely by the Sperry
Gyro-Compass from Portsmouth to the Falkland Islands. When
an azimuth was finally taken the magnetic compass was found
to be out about 22 degrees. The <i>Invincible</i> arrived at the
Falkland Islands just in time to coal before the German fleet
appeared. If H. M. S. <i>Invincible</i> had not had a Gyro-Compass
the probabilities are that she would not have reached the
Falkland Islands in time to win the battle which took place
almost immediately upon her arrival.<br class="clearfix" /></p>

<p>Figure 49 shows a British submarine, a sister ship of the E-11, that entered the Sea
of Marmora through the Dardanelles for the purpose of destroying Turkish and German
shipping. The E-11 put a torpedo right into Constantinople harbor. The Second Officer
of the E-11 in relating this exploit, stated that they steered by the “Sperry” all the
way in and out. His remark was that, “It never let me down.”</p>

<p>In this exploit, and many others of a similar nature, the Gyro-Compass was used
for all navigation. These extremely daring and hazardous operations would not have
been possible without this instrument.</p>

<p>A similar British submarine left Harwich on the east coast of England, and during
a period of three weeks made seven patrol trips, and without once seeing the sun,
finally returned to Harwich and picked up the buoy at the mouth of the harbor without the
least difficulty. The navigation in this case was carried out entirely by the Gyro-Compass.</p>

<p>Figure 54 is a pho­to­graph of H. M. S. <i>Lion</i>, the flag­ship
of Ad­mir­al Beat­ty in the bat­tle of Jut­land. This ship was
pro­vid­ed with the Sper­ry Gy­ro-Com­pass equip­ment early in
the war. Dur­ing the Jut­land en­gage­ment a fire broke out in
a mag­a­zine of the <i>Lion</i> im­med­i­ate­ly be­low the two Mas­ter
Com­pas­ses which were lo­cat­ed in one com­part­ment. It be­came
so hot that the lead sheath­ing was melt­ed off the elec­tric
cab­les and one of the Gy­ro-Com­pas­ses was heat­ed until its
parts fused. Notwithstanding this same heat the other compass
functioned throughout the entire action. Of the ships
engaged in the battle of Jutland practically all except the
destroyers were equipped with the Gyro-Compass. Every one of
them performed perfectly throughout the action except in the
case of the <i>Lion</i> on which one was destroyed by fire.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
